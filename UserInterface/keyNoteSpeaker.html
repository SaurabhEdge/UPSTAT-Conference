                    Our beloved UPSTAT conference goes fully virtual this year! After having to cancel UPSTAT 2020, we couldn't let another year go by without a weekend full of statistics. This year, our theme is inspired by the tumultuous year our home nation has had. We
                    seek to explore how statistics can help us to serve social justice in terms of new methodology, using it to understand data in an applied way, and how to educate students to think critically about data.

                    <b>Gipsy Escobar, PhD, Director of Product Strategy:</b> Dr. Gipsy Escobar has extensive multidisciplinary criminal justice research experience designing and managing complex research projects, mentoring staff, and communicating research results to varied audiences. As MFJ's Director of Research and Analytics (2015 to 2018) she worked with national experts to design and validate a system of performance measurement for local criminal justice and to develop a robust methodology to standardize the management of criminal justice data from varied sources across jurisdictions in the United States. Currently, as MFJ's Director of Product Strategy, she's responsible for understanding the market landscape as well as the voice of our customers and external stakeholders. She uses this knowledge to inform the prioritization of the Product Roadmap for external products, advise and cultivate key partnerships, and take a key role in representing these perspectives to MFJ stakeholders. Before joining MFJ, Dr. Escobar was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology and a faculty member of the Graduate School at Loyola University Chicago. She received her Ph.D. from John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
