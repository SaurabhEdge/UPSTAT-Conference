                    <b>Gipsy Escobar, PhD, Director of Product Strategy:</b> Dr. Gipsy Escobar has extensive multidisciplinary criminal justice research experience designing and managing complex research projects, mentoring staff, and communicating research
                    results to varied audiences. As MFJ's Director of Research and Analytics (2015 to 2018) she worked with national experts to design and validate a system of performance measurement for local criminal justice and to develop a robust
                    methodology to standardize the management of criminal justice data from varied sources across jurisdictions in the United States. Currently, as MFJ's Director of Product Strategy, she's responsible for understanding the market landscape
                    as well as the voice of our customers and external stakeholders. She uses this knowledge to inform the prioritization of the Product Roadmap for external products, advise and cultivate key partnerships, and take a key role in representing
                    these perspectives to MFJ stakeholders. Before joining MFJ, Dr. Escobar was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology and a faculty member of the Graduate School at Loyola University Chicago. She
                    received her Ph.D. from John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Her research interests include crime and justice measurement, court case processing, prosecutorial decision-making,
                    program evaluation, and the spatial study of crime correlates at the community level.

                    <b>Sema Taheri, PhD, Director of Research Operations:</b> Sema Taheri joined MFJ in 2016. As the Director of Research Operations at Measures for Justice, Sema collaborates with the Outreach team to develop MFJ's data collection protocol,
                    co-manages the development and implementation of a rigorous methodology for data management, and directs the general operations of the Research team. She also collaborates closely with MFJ's leadership to advance the organization's
                    research agenda. Sema has worked closely with sheriffs' offices on a number of projects, including evaluations of correctional treatment programming, and the analyses of trends in the jail population. At MFJ, she has also worked closely
                    with practitioners across the system on projects related to data standards, performance measure development, and evaluation. Her dissertation research focused on the gap between research and practice and the development of partnerships
                    to guide data-led policy and programming within criminal justice agencies. Sema holds a Ph.D. in Criminology & Justice Policy from Northeastern University and a M.A. in Criminology & Criminal Justice from Loyola University Chicago.
                    Her research interests include institutional and community corrections, offender reentry, CJ organizations, and program evaluation.
