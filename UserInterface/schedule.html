                            Leveraging Criminal Justice Data to Shed Light on Racial and Other Disparities in the System Gipsy Escobar, PhD, Director of Product Strategy (read bio) Sema Taheri, PhD, Director of Research Operation (read bio) Abstract: Common ground is in short supply.
                            The same goes for accountability and transparency. As a result, public trust in the criminal justice system is at an all time low. In this climate, lasting reform is extremely difficult to achieve. Measures for Justice (MFJ)
                            is a non-partisan, non-profit organization with a mission to arm communities and practitioners with their own data to create sustainable solutions to systemic problems in criminal justice. When the public, police, prosecutors,
                            and courts share and trust the same data, those data become the common ground for dialog and reform. Dr. Escobar and Dr. Taheri will discuss an initiative to partner with prosecutor offices across the country to develop a public
                            dashboard where everyone in the community can: (1) track progress toward a shared criminal justice goal; (2) track monthly data on how cases flow through the system; and (3) break down all data by demographics like race and
                            ethnicity, sex, age, indigent status, homelessness, among other things. They will discuss the tools used to turn prosecutor case management data into actionable, measurable information; the challenges of working with criminal
                            justice data; a model for the community and the prosecutor to work together to co-create a joint space for making criminal justice data transparent and shared goals public; and plans to integrate data from other areas of criminal
                            justice, including policing.

                            the code alongside the presentation. In order to do so, attendees are recommended to download Python & Pandas through Anaconda (it should be free - install the corresponding version for your operating system and use default
                            settings): https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual The code for the tutorial can be downloaded here: https://github.com/viquangly/Training-Materials. During the day of the tutorial, please have the Python Tutorial.ipynb
                            & mpg dataset.csv on your desktop for easy access.

                            simple descriptive statistics and hypothesis tests, all the way to machine learning implemented on big data representing a half million flowers. The basics of R programming covered in this tutorial will include package management,
                            data input/output, subset/reshaping data, scientific graphics with ggplot2, and a variety of machine learning packages. Please bring a laptop. All 20+ R scripts are available at this website

                            Using Jigsaw puzzles to teach feature selection, teamwork, and diversity Presenter: Thomas Kinsman Custom designed jigsaw puzzles were created to teach feature selection to students of Data Science and Computer Vision courses. A team-oriented workshop
                            was developed and presented to students. The jigsaw puzzles cannot be easily solved without using a diverse set of features, hence the importance of having a diverse set. However, the workshop was carefully rigged to prevent
                            any one team member from seeing all of the features, forcing participants to collaborate. Some jigsaw puzzles were printed all one color, making them difficult to solve, and emphasized the need for diverse features and viewpoints
                            to help solve the problem. In the final stage of the workshop, the students were taught a shared solution strategy which drastically improved their solution speed. The workshop curriculum points out analogies to people from
                            diverse backgrounds, who are deaf, and who are colorblind. Participants overwhelmingly reported that this experience helped them understand the importance of a diversity of viewpoints, the importance of combining features,
                            and the importance of teamwork in Data Science and Computer Vision. The students enjoyed this workshop, and learned about feature selection. This workshop reports on the puzzle design, the surprising revelation of how the workshop
                            curriculum was rigged, and the results of the original, multi-year study.
