                    UPSTAT goes fully virtual this year! After having to cancel UPSTAT 2020, we couldn't let another year go by without a weekend full of statistics.<br /><br />This year, our theme is inspired by the tumultuous year our home nation has
                    had. We seek to explore how statistics can help us to serve social justice in terms of new methodology, using it to understand data in an applied way, and how to educate students to think critically about data.
