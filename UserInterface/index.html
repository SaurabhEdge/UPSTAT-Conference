                    Our beloved UPSTAT conference goes fully virtual this year! After having to cancel UPSTAT 2020, we couldn't let another year go by without a weekend full of statistics. This year, our theme is inspired by the tumultuous year our home nation has had. We
                    seek to explore how statistics can help us to serve social justice in terms of new methodology, using it to understand data in an applied way, and how to educate students to think critically about data.

                    The UPSTAT conference series aims to serve as a friendly and empowering forum for the annual gathering of statisticians, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers, and data scientists from upstate New York and its neighboring regions. Graduate
                    students and advanced undergraduate students involved in research are especially welcome and strongly encouraged to present their research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The theme for this year’s meeting is
                    <strong> Serving Social Justice</strong>. This year we intend to gather statisticians, mathematicians, engineers, computer scientists and data scientists to come together around this theme touching Statistics and Data Science Methods
                    and Techniques at the Service of Social Justice. We are soliciting abstract submissions related to the theme of the conference, but we also welcome submissions related to the analysis of data from all fields of application of statistics,
                    artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science. We are interested in contributions to statistical methodology as well as to statistical practice, consulting, and education. Moreover, we would welcome submissions at the
                    interface of statistics and other disciplines such as computer science, environmental studies, biology/medicine, social sciences, and business/finance.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Novel contributions to statistical methods or computing </strong> – If you have developed new statistical methods or approaches to the analysis of data, we strongly encourage you to consider submitting an abstract to present
                        your work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
							Applications of statistical methods to interesting data sets from criminal justice,
							social justice, bias and fairness in computing, environmental studies,
							biology/medicine, social sciences, business/finance, and other fields
						</strong> – If you are an applied statistician working in academia or in industry, and have worked on interesting problems involving the analysis of complex (possibly large) data sets, then consider submitting an abstract
                        to present your problem and the analysis that you performed to gain insight into your scientific question.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Issues in statistics / data science education</strong> – If you have taught courses related to statistics or data science to high school students, undergraduate students, or graduate students, consider giving a presentation
                        on novel approaches that you may have implemented. Presentations that touch on the role that other disciplines should play in developing curricula in these fields would also be of great interest.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Presenters will have the option of submitting a detailed version of their unpublished work as a manuscript to be peer-reviewed and eventually published in the journal Mathematics for Applications, indexed by MathSciNet.
                </p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <br/> Since its inception in 2012, the UP STAT conference series has uninterruptedly gathered the most eager practicing statisticians and data scientists of our beautiful upstate New York region every single year. Thanks to the remarkable
                    and commendable commitment of statistical practitioners and faculty members along with their dedicated students from Rochester Institute of Technology, University of Rochester, St John Fisher College, Canisius College, SUNY Geneseo,
                    SUNY Buffalo, SUNY Buffalo State, SUNY Fredonia, SUNY Binghamton, SUNY Oneonta, SUNY Oswego, SUNY Albany, Niagara University, Syracuse University, St Bonaventure College, SUNY Brockport, City University of New York (CUNY) and Cornell
                    University. The conference has occasionally welcomed participants from as far as Carnegie Mellon University. The UP STAT conference series has become the annual gathering forum for all the statisticians and data scientists of upstate
                    New York. With very little means, we have harnessed the talents of our volunteer organizing committee members to build the UP-STAT conference series into a very promising vehicle for cutting edge Statistical and Data Science education
                    in our Upstate New York region.
